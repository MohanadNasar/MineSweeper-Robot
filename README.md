<h1>Minesweeper Robot AI </h1>

<h3>Project Description</h3>

In this project, you have implemented an AI module for a Minesweeper robot using Haskell. The robot operates within a 4x4 grid of cells, and each cell can be in one of three states: empty, containing the robot, or containing a mine. The robot has the ability to move in all four directions and can collect a mine only when it is in the same cell as the mine.

Your program takes as input the initial position of the robot and the positions of all the mines. The primary objective of the AI module is to compute a sequence of actions that will guide the robot to visit all the mines and collect them.

<h3>Technologies Used</h3>
Haskell: The project is implemented using the Haskell programming language, known for its functional programming capabilities.
This project demonstrates how Haskell can be applied to solve complex problems, showcasing its flexibility and power in artificial intelligence and robotics.

Feel free to expand the "Technologies Used" section to include any additional tools or libraries you used during the project.
